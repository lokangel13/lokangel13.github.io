            Angel is a final year master student of Health Informatics. She is a
            dedicated nurse and is passionate about her job. With the emerging
            IT in healthcare, such as electronic health record, telemedicine,
            virtual realities etc, she believes this program can better prepare
            her for future opportunites and challenges.
            <br /><br />She chose this course because she heard good feedback
            from her classmates who like her, do not have much knowledge of
            computer programming/ web design. Also, she was an avid blogger
            (Xanga) and Neopets player when she was a teen, which involved a bit
            of web design. <br /><br />
            She likes listening to music, watching movies and reading (<a
              href="moreabout.html"
              style="color: rgb(66, 45, 19)"
              >Reference</a
            >). She also enjoys weightlifting, swimming and hiking to stay
            active. <br /><br />
            Being a proud owner (slave) of 2 cats,
            <br /><img
              src="Photos/cat1.jpg"
              title="Coffee and Milk"
              width="100px"
            />
            <br />she is interested in topics like animal welfare and veganism.
            Sustainability, ethics, human rights also interest her. Discussion
            is welcome and she wishes to be enlightened with different
            viewpoints and opinions. <br /><br />She considers herself friendly,
            open-minded and compassionate but sarcastic with a weird sense of
            humour (as evidenced by this Webpage). Although she has shortcomings
            such as laziness, not taking things seriously, being too
            introverted, she is introspective and is eager to learn and improve.

            <br /><br />
            P.S this assignment may or may not be done by her cat.
